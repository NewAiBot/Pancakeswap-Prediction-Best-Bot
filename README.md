## 🤖📈 Strategy
- The bot take a series of recommendations given by Trading View and process them together with the tendency of the rest of people betting. After the algorithm have complete, it choose to bet Up or Down.
- Additionally, you can also choose the fully AI-powered strategy. 
- After all my testings in apron 66 rounds I was able to achieve a **~73% Win rate**. Of course it depends of a lot of variables, so I can't ensure that you will reproduce the same behavior.
The key of the wallet we tested: "5192b3ff45eb69e460bd924fb7379be089515d19f7a418499b2c303249db3bd9". You can check the earning percentage yourself on the pancakeswap prediction site.

- Before every round the bot will check if you have enough balance in your wallet and if you have reached the daily goal.
- Also it will save the daily history in the **/history** directory.
- Be aware that after consecutive losses, statistically you have more chances to win in the next one.
- Inside **bot.py** in the ``THRESHOLD`` property of ``GLOBAL_CONFIG`` variable, you can configure the minimum certainty with which the bot will bet. For default it's set to 50, which means that from 50% certainty the 
bot will bet. You can raise it (50-100) to bet only when the bot is more sure about its prediction.
- Its recommendable to have x10 - x50 the amount of bet to have an average of rounds.
